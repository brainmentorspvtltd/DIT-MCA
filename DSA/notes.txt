1D Array
- Array is one of the oldest and simplest data structure
- used to store data with similar data type
Good Parts of Array
- It provides random access
- Cache friendly
  - Cache is the memory near to processor
  - cache always brings the nearby data (contiguous data)
  - because elements are continuous so next index element is always present on cache...

Syntax of 1D Array
int x[] = {1,2,3,4};
int []x = {1,2,3,4};
int x[] = new int[5]
int x[] = new int[]{1,2,3,4};

Array CRUD Operations
C - Create
R - Read
U- Update
D - Delete
Array Questions
1. Find Largest element in array
2. Second Largest element in array
3. Span of an Array - HW
   - arr[] = {2,1,3,19,12,15,6}
   - span of an array : difference b/w the minimum and maximum element of array
   - span = 19 - 1 = 18
4. Print Bar Chart
5. Array is sorted or not - HW
    - arr[] = {2,3,1,4,5,6,7}
    - o/p : no
6. Reverse an Array
7. Pair Sum
Two Pointer Approach
8. Remove Duplicate element from sorted array - HW
   arr[] = {1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,5,6,7,7,7,7}
   o/p = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
9. Convert array into zig zag fashion / wave array - HW
    - a < b > c < d > e
   i/p : [4,3,7,8,6,2,1]
   o/p : [3,7,4,8,2,6,1]
   hint - start loop from start to end, check if the first element is greater than second element so       swap it, else if first element < second element so swap second time...
10. Leader Element in an array
11. Addition of 2 array elements
12. Subtraction of 2 array elements - HW
